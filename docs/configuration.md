# Configuration

## MCP Client Configuration

The easiest way to configure UE-MCP is to run `npx ue-mcp init` — it detects your MCP clients and writes the config automatically.

### Manual Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ue-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["ue-mcp", "C:/path/to/MyGame.uproject"]
    }
  }
}
```

Codex uses TOML instead:

```toml
[mcp_servers.ue-mcp]
command = "npx"
args = ["ue-mcp", "C:/path/to/MyGame.uproject"]
cwd = "C:/path/to"
enabled = true
```

### Where to Put This

| Client | Config File |
|--------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` in project root, or `~/.claude/` global config |
| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Cursor | `mcp.json` in `.cursor/` or project root |
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` |

### Without a Project Path

You can start the server without a `.uproject` argument. It will run in a limited mode — you can then use `project(action="set_project", projectPath="...")` at runtime to attach to a project.

## Project Configuration (`ue-mcp.yml`)

Project config lives in `ue-mcp.yml` next to your `.uproject`, tracked in git so every collaborator shares the same surface. `npx ue-mcp init` scaffolds and maintains it.

```yaml
ue-mcp:
  version: 1
  contentRoots: [/Game/, /MyPlugin/]
  disable: [gas]
  nativeTools: { enabled: true }
  http: { enabled: false }
  context: { strategy: full }
tasks: {}
flows: {}
plugins: []
```

The file is one layer in a deep-merged stack (user-global → project → env → local → env vars). For the full anatomy, the layer cascade, where each setting belongs, and every `ue-mcp:` key, see the dedicated **[ue-mcp.yml Reference](config-file.md)**. The behavioral deep-dives for two of its keys live below: [Native Epic tools](#native-epic-5-8-tools) (`nativeTools`) and [Context strategy](#context-strategy-full-lean-micro) (`context`).

### Native Epic 5.8 tools

Unreal Engine 5.8 ships an experimental AI Toolset Registry (the plugin behind Unreal's own MCP server). ue-mcp reaches that registry in-process and surfaces every official toolset as first-class actions inside the matching ue-mcp category - Epic's GAS tools appear in `gas`, Niagara in `niagara`, and so on - so an agent discovers them in context. Toolsets with no natural home are reachable through the `epic` gateway (`status` / `list_toolsets` / `describe_toolset` / `call_tool`).

- **On by default.** `npx ue-mcp init` includes a "Native Unreal tools (Epic 5.8)" page where you enable the feature and optionally exclude specific categories. The choice is written to `nativeTools` in `ue-mcp.yml`.
- **Requires UE 5.8+** with the `ToolsetRegistry` plugin (and the toolset plugins you want) enabled in your project. On older engines or when the plugin is absent, enrichment is skipped and `epic(status)` reports `available: false`.
- **Deterministic surface.** The catalog is sourced from the live editor when connected, falling back to a per-project cache and then a snapshot baked into the ue-mcp package, so the wrapped tools appear even on a cold first start and match the generated [tool reference](tool-reference.md) (both are built from the same snapshot). The 🧩 badge in the tool reference marks every wrapped official tool.

To turn it off entirely, set `nativeTools.enabled: false` (the `epic` gateway stays available). To keep it on but drop a noisy domain, add that category to `nativeTools.exclude`.

The feedback approval mode (`interactive` / `auto-approve` / `defer`) is intentionally **not** in `ue-mcp.yml` — it varies per developer and per machine, so it lives in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json` and is managed with `npx ue-mcp feedback mode ...` or the `UE_MCP_FEEDBACK_MODE` env var. See [Feedback → modes](feedback.md#feedback-modes).

### User-machine state (`~/.ue-mcp/`)

Machine-specific state that ue-mcp commands write but you wouldn't hand-edit lives under `~/.ue-mcp/`:

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `~/.ue-mcp/state.json` | Two things: (a) per-project `installedHooks` — absolute paths of every Claude Code `settings.json` where ue-mcp installed the feedback PostToolUse hook, keyed by absolute project root; (b) `preferences.feedback.mode` — your personal default for the feedback approval mode (`interactive` / `auto-approve` / `defer`). Maintained by `npx ue-mcp init`, `npx ue-mcp uninstall-hooks`, and `npx ue-mcp feedback mode`. |
| `~/.ue-mcp/auth.json` | Cached GitHub OAuth token for `feedback(submit)` author=user mode. Mode 600. Written by `npx ue-mcp auth`. |
| `~/.ue-mcp/pending-feedback/<id>.json` | Submissions captured while `feedback mode` is `defer`. Acted on with `npx ue-mcp feedback list/approve/discard`. |

These files never need to be in your project tree or in version control.

## Plugins

The `plugins:` array in **`ue-mcp.yml`** declares npm packages that inject new actions into existing built-in categories. The full author contract lives in [Plugins](plugins.md); this is the consumer view.

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: pie-studio
  - name: some-other-plugin
    version: "0.2.x"        # optional - npm semver range
```

At server start, ue-mcp resolves each entry against the project's `node_modules/`, validates the plugin manifest, and merges its injected actions into the host category tools. Stay-on-disk facts:

- The package must already be installed under `<project>/node_modules/`. Use `ue-mcp plugin install <name>` to add an entry **and** run `npm install --save` in one step.
- Plugins are loaded only when the server boots — edit the array and restart your MCP client (`/mcp` in Claude Code).
- A plugin that fails validation is skipped with a loud warning. Other plugins keep loading; the host tools are never partially mutated.
- Use the `plugins` tool to introspect the loaded set:
  - `plugins(action="list")` — name, version, prefix, status, injected count, host UE plugin presence.
  - `plugins(action="describe", name="<package>")` — full detail including injected actions, knowledge files, and flows.

Order matters: earlier entries win on inter-plugin action-name collisions. A plugin action can never overwrite a built-in.

### Host UE plugin dependencies

A plugin can declare `uePluginDependency: <PluginName>` in its `ue-mcp.plugin.yml`. The MCP server checks the project's `.uproject` for `Plugins[].Name == "<PluginName>"` and exposes the result as `uePluginPresent` in `plugins(action="list")`. The npm side loads regardless — the flag is a signal that the host UE plugin needs to be enabled before the injected actions will actually run.

For example, a plugin that declares `uePluginDependency: SomePlugin` will report `uePluginPresent: false` until `SomePlugin` is added to `<Project>.uproject`'s `Plugins` array and the C++ modules are built.

## Context strategy (full, lean, micro)

Everything the server injects at session start - the `initialize` instructions plus the whole `tools/list` payload (names, descriptions, and parameter schemas) - is the "context tax". Three strategies trade that seed cost against how many discovery round-trips an agent makes. Measure the tax on your own project with `npm run context-tax` (set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for exact token counts).

| Strategy | Seed (test project) | What's advertised | Cost to use |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **`full`** (default) | ~45k tokens | all 22 category tools, every action + parameter inline | zero discovery calls |
| **`lean`** | ~23k tokens | the same 22 tools with their validated `action` enums, but descriptions collapsed to a summary; a `catalog` tool (`search` / `describe` / `list_categories`) and a per-category `describe` action serve the details on demand | ~1 round-trip to learn a category |
| **`micro`** | ~1k tokens | a single `tools` gateway - `list_categories`, `describe`, and `call` - fronting every category; nothing else | discovery for everything |

- **full** is best when the agent should see the entire surface up front and you are not token-constrained.
- **lean** keeps action names visible (so the model can often call directly, and unknown actions are still rejected up front) while dropping the prose. A solid middle ground.
- **micro** mirrors the native MCP toolset gateway (`list_toolsets` / `describe_toolset` / `call_tool`): the agent calls `tools(action="list_categories")`, then `tools(action="describe", category="blueprint")`, then `tools(action="call", category="blueprint", method="create", args={ ... })`. Smallest possible seed, most discovery traffic.

Set the strategy with the standalone command (writes `ue-mcp.yml` for you):

```
npx ue-mcp context full      # every action inline (default)
npx ue-mcp context lean      # names visible, descriptions on demand
npx ue-mcp context micro     # one gateway tool fronts everything
npx ue-mcp context           # show the current strategy
```

`npx ue-mcp init` also has a **Context strategy** page. Or edit `ue-mcp.yml` directly:

```yaml
ue-mcp:
  context:
    strategy: micro
```

Or per session, without editing the file: `UE_MCP_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=micro` (the env var wins over the config value). Anything other than `lean` or `micro` resolves to `full`. Restart your MCP client (`/mcp` in Claude Code) after changing the strategy.

## Bridge Connection

The C++ plugin listens on a **per-project WebSocket port** derived from a hash of the project root path (in the IANA ephemeral range `49152-65535`). Deriving the port from the path means two checkouts of the same project - or several unrelated projects - on one machine each get a stable, launch-order-independent port, so their MCP clients never collide on a single fixed number. The Node client and the C++ bridge compute the identical value independently, and the bridge also publishes the actual bound port to `<project>/Saved/UE_MCP_Bridge/port.json` as the authoritative source (if the port is already taken, the bridge probes upward and the lockfile records where it really landed). The legacy fixed port `9877` remains the fallback when no project root is known. Pin an explicit port with `UE_MCP_PORT` or `bridge.port` in `ue-mcp.yml`. The MCP server auto-connects on startup and reconnects every 15 seconds if the connection drops.

### Connection States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Connected** | Bridge is active, all tools available |
| **Disconnected** | Editor not running or plugin not loaded. Filesystem tools still work (INI parsing, C++ headers, asset listing) |
| **Reconnecting** | Connection lost, auto-retry in progress |

Check the current state with `project(action="get_status")`.

## Plugin Deployment

On first run with a project path, the server automatically:

1. Copies `plugin/ue_mcp_bridge/` → `<Project>/Plugins/UE_MCP_Bridge/`
2. Adds `UE_MCP_Bridge` to the `.uproject` plugins list
3. Enables `PythonScriptPlugin` if not already enabled (needed for `execute_python` escape hatch)

The plugin is editor-only and has no runtime footprint.

### Plugin Dependencies

The C++ bridge plugin enables these UE plugins (adding them to `.uproject` if missing):

- `PythonScriptPlugin` — for `editor(action="execute_python")`
- `EnhancedInput` — for input action/mapping creation
- `GameplayAbilities` — for GAS tools
- `Niagara` — for VFX tools
- `PCG` — for procedural generation tools

## CLI Subcommands

`npx ue-mcp` exposes a few utility subcommands beyond the default MCP server entry:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx ue-mcp init` | Interactive setup wizard. Deploys the C++ bridge plugin, writes MCP client configs, scaffolds `ue-mcp.yml`, optionally installs Claude Code skills + feedback prompt hook, optionally runs the GitHub OAuth device flow. Migrates any legacy `.ue-mcp.json` / `ue-mcp.local.yml` it finds. |
| `npx ue-mcp update` | Check npm for the latest version and install it. Pass `--deploy` to also redeploy the plugin sources. |
| `npx ue-mcp deploy` | Copy the C++ bridge plugin sources into the project. Use after `ue-mcp update` or to force a redeploy. |
| `npx ue-mcp build` | Build the project C++ code using Unreal Build Tool. Stop the editor first. |
| `npx ue-mcp auth` | Run the GitHub device flow standalone so `feedback(submit)` can author issues as your real GitHub user. Same step that lives inside `init`; use this if you skipped it at init time. |
| `npx ue-mcp uninstall-hooks` | Remove the feedback PostToolUse hook from every Claude Code settings file recorded for this project in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json`. |
| `npx ue-mcp feedback mode [<mode>]` | Read or set your personal feedback approval mode (`interactive`, `auto-approve`, or `defer`). Stored in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json`. See [Feedback → modes](feedback.md#feedback-modes). |
| `npx ue-mcp feedback list \| show \| approve \| discard \| review` | Manage submissions queued while feedback mode is `defer`. `review` (experimental) walks the queue interactively (approve/discard/skip per item). See [Feedback → Reviewing deferred submissions](feedback.md#reviewing-deferred-submissions). |
| `npx ue-mcp resolve <issue>` | Fetch a feedback issue, branch, hand it to Claude Code to implement, open a PR. See [Feedback](feedback.md#resolving-feedback-issues). |
| `npx ue-mcp plugin install <name>` | Install a ue-mcp plugin from npm and register it in `ue-mcp.yml`. See [Configuration → Plugins](#plugins). |
| `npx ue-mcp plugin uninstall <name>` | Inverse of install. |
| `npx ue-mcp plugin create <name>` | Scaffold a new plugin package. See [Plugins](plugins.md). |
| `npx ue-mcp context [full\|lean\|micro]` | Read or set the [context strategy](#context-strategy-full-lean-micro) in `ue-mcp.yml`. No argument prints the current strategy. |

## Editor Lifecycle

The server can manage the editor process:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `editor(action="start_editor")` | Launch UE with the current project |
| `editor(action="stop_editor")` | Gracefully stop the editor through Unreal's native MainFrame shutdown path |
| `editor(action="restart_editor")` | Stop and relaunch |
| `editor(action="build_project")` | Build the project C++ code via UBT |
